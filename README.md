# Study of the transcriptome during intense exercises in highlands 

## Project goals and objectives

The aim of this project is to study differential genes expression of 19 sportsmans during physical and psychological stress before and after running in extreme highlands conditions (2450-3450 m, Elbrus m.) and also in "start" point before arrival at competition (
St. Petersburg).

### Tasks

1. Processing and evaluating the quality of raw reads
2. Alignment to the human reference genome ()
3. Count gene and isoform expression level
4. Analysis of differential gene expression
5. Functional analysis of differentially expressing genes
6. Ð¡luster analysis
